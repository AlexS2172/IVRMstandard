    combos.c

    This program attemps to 'test' the OM combo-pricing mechanism,
    as supplied to the ISE as in 'text' in April 2001

    We expect the caller to specify a script file.
    This script file has basic commands which set up our 'environment',
    with things like the bid and ask prices in our 'orderbook',
    and whether there are customer orders at those BBOs.
    These are then 'stored' in our orderbook, to be used when we play
    with the actual combos.

    It also allows us to specify the series, buy/sell, and ratios
    of the legs of a combo (always in one underlying), and the overall
    premium and quantity of a combo, and the other parameters of
    the combo, such as the step-up-to-bbo, and step-up-odd-contract
    attributes of the combo.

    The purpose of this is
    - to cross-check OM's logic, that the pre-check logic and
	the calculate-price algorithms actually correctly intersect
    - to check if OM's logic of calculating the prices and quantities
	for the legs / ratios etc actually always comes up with the correct
	price (or nearest). We have some doubts about the price when
	there are ratios AND quantities in the combo, and when there
	are ratios and an odd-quantity
    - to be able to easily put in some pre-conditions, and find out what we
	should expect (presuming we don't find errors in the previous cases),
	which should be helpful for generating the ATPs for testing combos.

    We need to check for
    - standard 2 leg 1:1 contracts (e.g. price-spread and time-spread)
    - standard 3 and 4 leg 1:1 contracts
    - combinations with all legs < price-tick boundary, all > boundary, some each way
    - combinations with non-standard 'simple' ratios, like 2:1
    - combinations with non-standard 'odd' ratios, like 7:3
    - combinations with even and odd numbers (including 1) of contracts, including
	different flavours of step-up-to-bbo and step-up-odd-contract
    - combinations with narrow and wide market spreads
    - combinations with customer orders at the BBO in none, some, all legs
    - combinations with combo premium in low-tick (e.g. 5c, 15c), but some/all legs
	at high tick (e.g. 10c)
    - combinations with customer/MM combo being hit by customer/MM

    We might also need to check for some of
    - ? combinations with the away market better than ISE BBO. We should NOT
	be providing?
    - ? combinations with different tick tables (all penny, penny-nickel, dime-quarter) ?
    - ? combinations with hit-price not equal to existing combo-price, is we ask OM to do this.
	NB OM API messages / algorithm does NOT currently allow for this. I believe Greg
	thinks it should (hitting combo allowed to take a 'worse' price to get an
	execution) ?
    - ? combinations with different # deliverable equities per contract between legs e.g. some 100, some 200 ?
	If we are not allowing this, we should have IMP rules which rejects (standing) combos in such series.
	Or should we only allow combo trading where # deliverables is 100 ?

Calculating price for legs of a combo

Note :- get_ask and get_bid are used in the pre-check routine (part of step 3), 
and the calculation of price/volume (step 5). This is incorrect. As correctly noted 
in step 2, there are cases where we must NOT use the BBO from the book.
Having found the adjusted prices in step 2, they are then incorrectly ignored
in steps 3 and 5, and we go back to working off the actual orderbook BBO,
which ignores the rule about at customer only allowed in any leg, if at least
one leg executes at a price better than the BBO.

There are also some unstated assumptions by OM
- the tick-table for the Calls and Puts are the same (obvious, but not actually an
OM requirement for anything else)
- the tick-table is Nickel/Dime. There may be Penny trading at some time, 
with Penny across all premiums, but this does not seem to create any problems with the algorithm.
- The validation for the existing combo (COB) has already enforced the requirement
for all legs to be in series in the same underlying
- We have validated (somewhere) the premium for the COB and HIT combos against the tick-table.
- The existing combo (COB) has enforced the requirement that the contract size in
all of the instrument classes are the same


Issues about rounding

The problem arises when the closest valid tick is sought for the multiplied price.
The regular functions can not be used, since it would look in the appropriate range for the multiplied price. 
What is interesting here is the tick size in the range where the price for each regular contract will end up, 
since the information is used to find the closest valid tick that is equal or less than the multiplied price. 
Therefore the multiplied price is divided by the multiplier, the tick size in that range is found, and the 
multiplied price is truncated to the closest value that is a valid tick according to the tick size obtained above.

5. Calculate prices/volumes

Function: calculate prices
Parameters in:
- net_pri

Result out:
- l_pri[1..4]	(lower alternative for the price of each leg)
- lp_vol[1..4]	(volume for each leg that should execute at lower price)
- h_pri[1..4]	(higher alternative for the price of each leg)
- hp_vol[1..4]	(volume for each leg that should execute at higher price)
Note that these are already sorted according to the index, i.e. l_pri[1..4] <->  leg[ind[1..4]]. 
Also note that hp_vol[i] can be zero for one or more legs.

Call the function that calculates the price and volume for each leg, see above. 
The result is stored in the structures listed below. Note that the sorting of the legs 
in these structures so that the index unsorting is not needed. Also note that some further
validation is done when calling this function
l_pri[1..4]		<-> leg[ind[1..4]]
lp_vol[1..4]		etc
h_pri[1..4]
hp_vol[1..4]
