Function : find_instr_group
Author	 : Neil Cossor
Modified : 9906xx
Description:

    routine which searches within the click data we have, to find the
    block of data about an instrument group, and return a pointer to it

Input Params :

    pointer to the block of CLICK data
    the number of the instrument group we wish to find

Output Params :

    pointer to the block of instrument_xt data if found,
    or NULL

Function:   sort_instrument_classes
Author:     Neil Cossor
Modified:   9907xx
Description:

    We have just received all the class info (or had an update).

    Generate the (sorted) structures pointing to these.

    Keeping in mind that the defining properties of an instrument class are
    country, market, underlying, and instrument group,
    we just sort on those. We should NEVER have duplicates.

Input Params:

    pointer to everything we know about one country / market
    flag if we are replacing the tables. TRUE means replacing, FALSE means new tables

Function : update_one_instrument_class
Author	 : Neil Cossor
Modified : 9909xx
Description:

    We have a pointer to a da210 record (from a dq210 query, or a bi210 bcast),
    and we have a pointer to a ISEsim internal record to hold the data for this.

    The item may be an add (dq210, or bi210 add), where we have just allocated space
    or a modify (bi210 modify), where we have found the original block.

Input Params:

    pointer to structure containing everything we currently know about the central system
    pointer to the (ISEsim internal) structure to hold everything about one instrument class
    pointer to the record containing everything about one instrument class that CLICK told us
