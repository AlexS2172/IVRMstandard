Function : delete_order
Author	 : Neil Cossor
Modified : 9905xx
Description:

    We have been asked to delete one/some orders.

    Calls the appropriate routine to carry this out, including the deletion
    from both the local orderbook, and the market (i.e. central orderbook).

Input Params:

    standard argc/argv params that got us here i.e. the command.
    Choices of command are:-

    Delete,L[ocal],<local order #>	one order, using local order number
    Delete,R[eference],<xref>		(one) local order, with particular cross-reference
    Delete,S[eries],<seriesname>	ALL local orders for one series
    Delete,U[nderlying],<undername>	ALL local orders for one underlying
    Delete,*				ALL local orders for ALL underlying
    Delete,%O				the order which we last snapshot-saved

    Note that each argv[] string has had leading whitespace stripped

Output Params:

    updated local and central orderbook

/*
Function : amend_order
Author	 : Neil Cossor
Modified : 9908xx
Description :

    This function collects the data for a change of quantity to
    an existing order, to do a MO103 transaction.

    the input (to be sent), which we must get from somewhere include
    - series, which MUST be specified
    - orderID, which MUST be specified
    - bid / ask, as per original order
    - the orderbook #, which we can derive from the series->underlying->orderbook

    The fields which may be changed are
    - quantity
    - free text (Xref)
    - validity time
    - ignore away market
    - broker id
    - open / close flag

    Note ISE does NOT allow an amend operation to change the premium.

Input Params:

    the usual C-style argc/argv[] from the command line
    If any of these are supplied with NULL pointers, or 0 (string) values,
    then NUL is packed into the MO103, which tells the MP server to leave
    the old value as it was for that field.

    argv[0]	AMEND
    argv[1]	<Bid|Ask>	or %O (bid/ask from last order)
    argv[2]	<series name>	or %O (series name from last order)
    argv[3]	<orderID>	or %O (orderID from last order)
    (optional, although at least ONE of these must be supplied, or there was no point amending)
    argv[4]	<new quantity>
    argv[5]	<new free-text (Xref)>
    argv[6]	<new validity-time>
    argv[7]	<new ignore-away market setting>
    argv[8]	<new broker-id>
    argv[9]	<new open-close flag value>

/*
Function:   query_orders
Author:     Neil Cossor
Modified:   9907xx
Description:

    Go find out about orders from the system orderbook.
    If we are inquiring on active orders, then update the local orderbook.

    Get the subset qualifier by the argc/argv parameters

    This was triggered by a 
    GET,<ACTIVE|INACTIVE>,<*|S|U>[,<series name>|>underlying name>]

Input Params:

    Standard argc/argv of the command line.
    Note that this command does NOT do interactive prompting for
    params if the arguments are not supplied.

    argv[2] may have values of
    - "*"	    all orders in all series (and hence all underlying)
    - Series	    specifies that argv[3] is a series name,
		    i.e. collect all orders in that particular series
    - Underlying    specifies that argv[3] is an underlying name
		    i.e. collect all orders for all series under a particular underlying

Output Params:

    If collecting active orders. updates the local orderbook
    If not, then displays the inactive orders.

/*
Function:   external_update_order
Author:	    Neil Cossor
Modified:   20010531
Description:

    We have info to update an item in our local orderbook with.

    If we don't know about the order at all (search by orderID)
    then we create an order entry item, and add it into the local orderbook.

    This could be triggered by a MQ101 query,
    a BO130 orderbook broadcast (with an add/modify flavour), 
    or maybe just a locktype change (BO115).

    In any case, we know about the change from an OM-formatted external message,
    rather than from us generating the order (from ISEsim command),
    so the input fields are in OM central-system order.

    This routine is hence very similar to update_order, BUT
    does the necessary byte-swapping.
    
    The conversion of OM string formats to C-style NUL-terminated strings
    is done by the caller, as it is messier keeping track of the field sizes here,
    and the CMTA and sub-account fields are sometimes packed as a
    single 10-char field, and sometimes as 2 5-char fields
