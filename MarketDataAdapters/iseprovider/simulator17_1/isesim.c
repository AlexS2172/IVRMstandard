Title : ISESim.c
Author:  Neil Cossor
Description :

    This file contains the startup / shutdown components of the ISESim.exe program.
    The file, main.c, contains the routine which starts things up.. if, of course,
    we are in a pure C, command-line environment... there are other options,
    which could call these routines.
    
    ISESim is a demonstration program for users of the ISE CLICK system,
    as supplied by the OM Gruppen.
    
    It demonstrates connection / logon and disconnection / logoff with the
    ISE CLICK Trading System, the basic transactions of the system, and an example of the
    processing of the broadcasts from the system.
    
    Now modified to be portable on either Windows NT V4 (Intel, Service Pack 3 and higher)
    and Solaris (Sparc). Testing of the Sparc version is, at present, outside
    ISE facilities.
