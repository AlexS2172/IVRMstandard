Description:

    we received a broadcast about an combo delete.

    - the orderID to attempt to delete.. in local-endian order UNLESS
    - the local_byte_order param indicates FALSE i.e. need to swap the bytes pre search

Description:

    We have info to update an item in our local combobook with.

    If we don't know about the combo at all (search by orderID)
    then we create a combo entry item, and add it into the local combobook.

    This could be triggered by a MQ131 or MQ132 query,
    a BO131 or BO132 combobook broadcast (with an add/modify flavour).

    In any case, we know about the change from an OM-formatted external message,
    rather than from us generating the combo (from ISEsim command),
    so the input fields are in OM central-system order.

    This routine is hence very similar to update_combo, BUT
    does the necessary byte-swapping.
    
    The conversion of OM string formats to C-style NUL-terminated strings
    is done by the caller, as it is messier keeping track of the field sizes here,
    and the CMTA and sub-account fields are sometimes packed as a
    single 10-char field, and sometimes as 2 5-char fields

    Note the fields in the legs have been filled with local-format data already
