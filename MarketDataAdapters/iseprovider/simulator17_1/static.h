Title : static.h
Author:  Neil Cossor

Function :

    This file the header for static.c, which provides facilities to
    collect all static data from the central system, to the ISESim.exe program.

    Note that only ONE routine is provided at this time, which loads ALL
    subsidiary static data.

    If some smaller granularity is required, then we will either have to add
    some selection criteria to that routine, or provide access to the lower
    level routines, which are currently private to the module.
