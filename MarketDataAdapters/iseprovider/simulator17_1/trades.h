Function : query_historical_deals
Author	 : Neil Cossor
Modified : 9907xx
Description : 

    We wish to know something about a past days deals

    Deal sequencing is within instrument group, so if you want to know
    about all deals, you must make a number of queries, at least one per instrument
    group.

    Also, the answer is NOT segmented.. instead, if the max # of deals that can
    fit in a response are supplied, then (at least) one more query should be
    done, using a start sequence # of 1 higher than the last deal that was
    in this response

Input Params:

    argv[0]	TRADES
    argv[1]	HISTORICAL
    argv[2]	<start date - yyyymmdd>
    argv[3]	<end date - yyyymmdd>

    argv[4]	<start time> - hhmmss, default 000000
    argv[5]	<end time> - hhmmss, default 235959 ????
    argv[6]	<instrument group | *>	default to * - get all instrument groups

/*
Function:   trade_rectify
Author:     Neil Cossor
Modified:   9908xx
Description:

    We have (previously) sent an order, which has traded.
    Unfortunately, some of the details relating to settlement
    were incorrect. Presumably OCC has failed the settlement,
    which the B/D knows about (by some other means).

    This transaction (CD33) allows the owner Broker/Dealer
    to 'fix' those incorrect things. The corrections are then
    forwarded to OCC (probably an overnight batch thing).

Input Params:

    the command line stuff (argc,argv[])
    argv[0]	TRADE
    argv[1]	RECTIFY
    argv[2]	<series name>
    argv[3]	<trade #>
    argv[4]	<CMTA member>
    argv[5]	<sub account ID>
    argv[6]	<account type>
    argv[7]	<open / close flag>
    argv[8]	<customer info> i.e. free text / Xref

Output Params:

Notes:

    Can you, as per amending an order, specify to NOT replace some fields,
    by putting NULs in those fields ? If so, then (for example), if the
    caller specifies 0 for the open / close flag, it will NOT change the
    setting for the trade...

/*
Function:   trade_rectify_parts
Author:     Neil Cossor
Modified:   0103xx
Description:

    This transaction is similar to the CD33, for altering insensitive
    details of a trade, after the fact (clearing details etc).

    However, the CD36 transaction (new for 16.3) allows the client to
    change the attributes of the trade in pieces.. if the original trade was
    for 100 contracts, the trade could be altered differently for
    a set of 20, 30 and 50.

    Obviously the total quantity specified in all parts cannot exceed the
    total quantity of the trade.

    I presume that if the original was 100, and changes are done on
    lots of 20 and 30, then 50 remain with their original values.

Input Params:

    the command line stuff (argc,argv[])
    argv[0]	TRADE
    argv[1]	RECTIFY
    argv[2]	<series name>
    argv[3]	<trade #>

    argv[4]     <quantity we are changing details for part 1>
    argv[5]	<CMTA member for this qty>
