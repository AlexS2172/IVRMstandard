Function:   select_string_option
Author:     Neil Cossor
Modified:   9908xx
Description:

    We have an input string, which we (hope) selects one of those
    from a (compile-time) known list of string choices.

    The input string (which is assumed to be the same case as the strings
    in the search array), is supposed to uniquely match against one
    of the strings in the supplied string array.

    A match may be a substring.

    It is possible for multiple matches.. which is an error.
    For example if there are choices LOGGER, and LOAD, then and input
    string of LO would be ambiguous.

    To check for ambiguity, we compare the input string
    against every string in the choices_s array, unless of course,
    we have already found that it is an ambiguous choice.

    We assume that the list of possible choices is fairly small,
    or this would be rather inefficient.

    If the caller maintains a enumerated list (starting from 0)
    which corresponds 1:1 with the choices list, then the value
    of our return integer can be used directly in a comparison
    (or switch) against the enumerated choices.

Input Params:

    The number of string choices we have
    The array of possible strings (with no duplicates)
    The string which we are trying to identify (uniquely match)

Output Params:

    If a (unique) match is found, then return the index # of the matching string
    which will, of course, have a value 0..(choices_u-1)

    If no match is found, then return the value choices_u

    If multiple matches are found (ambiguous string), then return the value (choices_u+1)

    If the input string has no ".", then we just shift left (decimal) by the
    appropriate # of positions.

    If the input string has a ".", then there must be at least one numeric digit
    after the decimal point.

    If there are more digits on the RHS of the decimal point than are allowed
    (in the decimal places), then this is an error.

    If there are less digits on the RHS, then we pad the RHS with the requisite # of
    zeroes.

    If the total # of digits in the LHS and RHS combined are greater than
    what can fit into an int i.e. > 9, then an error.

    For example,

    for an input of "23", digits 4 -> 230000
    for an input of "65.1", digits 4 -> 651000
    for an input of "40.12345", digits 4 -> error, truncated to 40.1234

Input Params:

    pointer to the string buffer to read from
    the number of implied decimals.. 0..9

Output Params:

    the (packed) resulting #...

    Note that as we are using sscanf, you could have "40. 35", with digits 4,
    and this would be interpreted as 40.3500.. rather than as an error

Description:

    fn which grabs the current date/time, and spits out the result in readable form to 
    the nominated file. Just like printf_time(), which goes to stdout.

    It does NOT add any newlines etc, just a space after the date/time.
    This way, we can get date/time at the start of lines of text logged.
