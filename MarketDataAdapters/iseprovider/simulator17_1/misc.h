Title:	misc.h
Author: Neil Cossor
Description:

    Header file for misc.c, miscellaneous routines for the ISEsim application.

    These are things that aren't really utility routines, but don't really
    justify a whole .h/.c module each... things like bin / exchange related
    functions.

    As we expect a very small number of bins (i.e. 10),
    just do a linear search, which will check against half of the bins, on average.
