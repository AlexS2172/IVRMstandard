Function : autoquote_change
Author	 : Neil Cossor
Modified : 20000110
Description:

    We have just had a change in the autoquote settings

    This could be setting interest rate, volatility, qty, open_qty or stepup,
    or turning autoquoting on or off

    All flavours have a common tail.. a list of items we are changing the settings for

Input Params:

    - pointer to everything we know about the current click session / system
    - which particular operation we are doing in changing the autoquote settings
    - an int32, which we are to use if the operation is a set of an integer e.g. step-up buffer
    - a double precision floating point, used if setting a double e.g.interest or volatility
    - C-style count of how many string args which follow
    - array of pointers to strings, each of which specifies an underlying / wildcard 
	we are to apply the autoquote settings to
