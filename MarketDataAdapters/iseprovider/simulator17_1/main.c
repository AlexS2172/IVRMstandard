Title : main.c
Author:  Neil Cossor
Description :

    This file is the main module of the ISESim.exe program.
    
    ISESim is a demonstration program for users of the ISE CLICK system,
    as supplied by the OM Gruppen.

    This module was split from the ISEsim.c file of earlier releases,
    to make the code more flexible for developers building test libraries
    based on our code, rather than just a simple stand-alone application

Function:   main
Author:     Neil Cossor
Modified:   20000122

Description:

   This function starts the program, gathers the log on data, logs on to the
   system, downloads various data, sets up the exit procedure,
   and kicks off the main loop.

Input Parameters:

    (generic C) The first string (argv[0]) is the program name, and each
    following string is an argument passed to the program from the command
    line. The last pointer (argv[argc]) is NULL.

    (app specific, if supplied.. may be NULLed by specifying "" in command line)
    argv[1] == name of logfile for output. Default LOGFILE.TXT
    argv[2] == name of User file, containing CLICK username, gateway name etc
	defaults to name (in const.h) #defined by USER_DATA_FILENAME
    argv[3] == name of script file to run. No default.
	If supplied, then it is
	- loaded immediately
	- run
	- and then the application exits
	If not supplied, then we run in interactive mode. Note that a script
	file can be LOADed and RUN from interactive mode.
