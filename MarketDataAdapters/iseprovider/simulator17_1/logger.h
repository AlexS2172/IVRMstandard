Title:	logger.h.
Author: Neil Cossor

Description:

    Defines fns, types, consts etc, provided by logger.c
    This module is the interface to the logger for the ISESim program.
    The logger runs as an independent thread, with a (inter-thread
    synchronised) Q, into which other threads can put things they wish
    logged.

/*
    this fn is responsible for logging a msg.
    It must force synchronisation restrictions, as it may be called by different threads,
    and we must NOT corrupt the stream of data being pumped into the logger thread

    The parameters are:-
    a msg header, which MUST be supplied
    the address of a buffer to log
    and the size of that buffer. If the size if 0, then do NOT log any
    of the data in the buffer

    Optionally can supply a logfile name, default used if none supplied

    Returns TRUE (non-zero) if everything OK, FALSE (0) otherwise.
    Parent process MUST terminate if NOT OK.

Function:   log_bcast
Author:     Neil Cossor
Modified:   9906xx
Description:

    We have received a CLICK broadcast. Log it.

    These are different from ordinary messages, in that they are NOT received
    one at a time, but in a block. This means that we can NOT use the easy
    logging from the normal tx/rx or query, where we know that the standard
    internal header (which has a fn_code, TxnStatus, TxnIdent and OrderIdent
    at the start) precede the actual body of the msg.

Input Params:

    the (internal) fn codes of the msgs for the logger. Ref global.h
    pointer to the broadcast we wish to log
    the size (in bytes) of the broadcast

Output Params

    None

Function:   log_text
Author:     Neil Cossor
Modified:   990908
Description:

    We have had some text we wish to add to the log. Log it.

    These don't have statii, secondary function codes etc.
    Initially, they have been added to allow the calling code to add more info,
    such as when we have had a bad status on a CLICK operation, then
    add the decoded text of the error statii.

Input Params:

    pointer to the text / string we wish to log - NUL terminated

Output Params

    None
