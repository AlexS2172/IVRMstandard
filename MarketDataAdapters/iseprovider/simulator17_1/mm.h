Description:

    PMM wishes to (manually) trade with against an existing order in the market.
    Uses MO112.

    While technically PMMs can trade against any order, the Legal and Surveillance
    issues are not so simple. Fortunately, this is an SEP - Someone Else's Problem

    Note that if we are using the same ISEsim session as whichever BD/operator
    sent the original order, and that order was snapshot-saved (using the SAVE command),
    then we can use %O to give us the shortcut to the series, orderID, and bid-ask of
    the original order.
    NB are we supposed to be putting in the bid/ask the same as the original order,
    or the opposite (which would be the most 'normal'/obvious thing to do)

Input Params:

    standard C-style arcg/argv params from the command line
    argv[0]	TRADE
    argv[1]	REPORT
    argv[2]	BID/ASK 	- can get %O, but is this correct (see note above)
    argv[3]	series name	- can use %O
    argv[4]	order number	- ditto

    argv[6]	premium
