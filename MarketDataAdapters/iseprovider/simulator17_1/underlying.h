    The underlyings are a combination of the static data retrieved

Function:   sort_underlying_tables
Author:	    Neil Cossor
Modified:   990913
Description:

    We have just finished loading all info about underlying
    within a particular country and market
    OR
    we just got a broadcast, which changed our previous tables.
    This could include an add or delete (so the # of entries in our sorted chains
    have changed), or a modify (so the sort order may be different).

    Generate the internal (sorted) lookup tables, which allow fast lookup
    of underlying.

Input Params:

    pointer to everything we know about one country / market
    flag if we are replacing the tables. TRUE means replacing, FALSE means new tables

    The results (if successful) are written into the structure for

Input Params:

	in the latest msg

Function:   check_all_underlying_instr_classes
Author:	    Neil Cossor
Modified:   990928
Description:

    We have complete data from the CDB.
    Check if we have instrument classes for all underlying.

    We also check that they have matching info, such as ranking types,
    tick tables, (and hence decimal trading vs fractions).

    We do this by looking through all known underlying, and for each look for
    an instrument class for all known instrument groups.

    This may not be valid where an OM exchange runs multiple markets,
    and only some instrument groups exist in each market.

    For the present time (one Options market within ISE),
    this will work correctly.
