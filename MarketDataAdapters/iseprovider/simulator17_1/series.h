Description:

    We have just finished loading all info about series

    OR
    we just got a broadcast, which changed our previous tables.
    This could include an add or delete (so the # of entries in our sorted chains
    have changed), or a modify (so the sort order may be different).
    
    Generate the internal (sorted) lookup tables, which allow fast lookup
    of series.

Input Params:

    pointer to everything we know about one country / market
    flag if we are replacing the tables. TRUE means replacing, FALSE means new tables

/*
Function:   point_series_at_underlying
Author:     Neil Cossor
Modified:   9907xx
Description:

    We have just finished loading all info about series AND underlying
    within a particular country and market
    OR
    we have just had an update to the series / underlying info (BI202, 204, 210 bcasts)

    Update pointer in each series, to point back at parent underlyings.
    This will save us having to look it up every time we reference things
    thru the series. For example, all ORDER functions require BIN and ORDERBOOK #.
    These are associated with the underlying.. but the orders are related to series..

    We can also report any series for which we do not know the underlying...

    We also add a link to the series into a chain hanging off the underlying.

    Note that in adding the links from the underlying TO the series, we are
    going thru the series in 'sorted by name' order, which means that if we
    then later go thru the series hanging off an underlying, we will be doing so
    in alphabetical order...

Input Params:

    pointer to everything we know about the CDB
    pointer to everything we know about one particular country / market
    flag if we are replacing the tables. TRUE means replacing, FALSE means new tables

    This routine can handle a series string of "%s",
    which means it will use the default series previously selected
    with the SET command (which will be NUL, if no default selected).

Input Params:

    The string which the user supplied in the command line.
    This should be a series name OR "%s"

Output Params:

    The pointer to the selected series, if found,
    otherwise NULL.

int cmp_series_by_ise_series_under ( ise_series_xt *first_series_px,

/*
Function:   cmp_series_by_ise_series_under
Author:     Neil Cossor
Modified:   9907xx
Description:

    routine needed to compare two records of data pointed to by the supplied
    params, and return a -1, 0, +1 value for whether the data pointed
    by first_series_px is <, ==, > the data pointed to by second_series_px

    Comparison is of the series ID. This has several fields. The order we sort / compare
    the fields in is not important, provided that we always do them in the same order.

    HOWEVER, this fn is used to sort with underlying as the first critical key,
    so all series with the same underlying will be grouped together.

    These are unique within a country / market - actually they are unique
    within a particular CLICK system.

    Used by cmp_series_ptr_by_ise_series_under, which are
    in turn called by qsort and bsearch.
    It is also used to compare the series in a query response msg to the
    series in the query request msg... as OM sometimes responds with
    data which is different to that in the request... (weird)
    
    Our order of comparison is
	country
	market
	underlying (== commodity, typically == an equity)   // hence _under
	instrument group
	expiry_date year
	expiry date month
	expiry date day
	strike price
	modifier
	
    With that order in mind...at each level,
    if the first_series_px->field < second_series_px->field,
    then we return -1.
    if the first_series_px->field > second_series_px->field
    then we return +1.
    If we are still here, then the field values are the same,
    and we drop to the next field for comparison.

    If we get to the end, we are equal, and we return a 0
